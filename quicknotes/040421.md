### Things we learned

* Form Builder
    * [`collection_select`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#the-collection-select-helper) generates a `select` from a list of objects
* Path helpers
    * `edit_X_path`
    * `Xs_path` (`lists_path` for example): path to the index
    * `link_to` accepts a `method` (`delete` for example)
    * `link_to` accepts a `data` field that can be set to `{confirm: "Confirm text"}` to display an alert before submitting the data
* Validation: `validates :field_name, presence: true, ...`
* Partials: prefixing a view with an underscore creates a partial that can be rendered in another view using `<%= render "partial_name", data: ... %>`

* Eager loading
    * to solve the n + 1 problem that comes with lazy loading data only when you need it, you can use `includes`. This method will allow you to eager load your data in the beginning
